# Immediate Task

Extend `scripts/build_blueprint.py` to generate multi-room blueprints and introduce tests ensuring the YAML matches the documented schema, outlining:
- rules for room/item/NPC creation (embedding-based selection vs. manual list);
- test coverage (unit test harness, sample data files);
- acceptance criteria for neighbor graph completeness and schema validation.
