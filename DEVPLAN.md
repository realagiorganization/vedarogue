# Development Plan - vedarogue

## Current Objective
Align research notebooks and docker tooling with the subtree sync workflow.

## Next Step
- Plan a validation run of the docker images to confirm workflows after documentation updates.

## Backlog
- Plan test run of new docker images once docs updated.
- Document how managed workers should interact with notebook pipelines.

## Notes
- Capture outcomes after each managed worker run and update this plan accordingly.
- codex-cli unavailable on current host; managed worker execution deferred.
- Docker docs and Makefile contain no hard-coded branch references.
