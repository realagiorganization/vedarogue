# Deployments & Build Catalog

This file is generated by CI (`scripts/generate_deployments_readme.sh`) to summarize each GitHub Actions run (artifacts, Docker images, metadata). The latest version is uploaded as a workflow artifact named `deployments-readme`.

During local development you can run the script manually, but artifact listing requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` and a specific `GITHUB_RUN_ID`.

Examples:
- In CI: generated automatically in the Docker build job.
- Locally (metadata may be partial):
  - `GITHUB_REPOSITORY=owner/repo GITHUB_RUN_ID=123456 GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx bash scripts/generate_deployments_readme.sh`
