# Immediate Task

Advance the blueprint generator toward dataset alignment:
- Teach `scripts/build_blueprint.py` to ingest the dataset lists-of-lists JSON, generate at least four rooms/items/NPCs, and record the interim graph strategy.
- Introduce the new schema test (pytest) to check room connectivity, item/NPC placement, and concept screen metadata.
- Document within `docs/roguelike_data_mapping.md` how audio hooks reference dataset manifests for each generated room.
