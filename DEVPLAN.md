# Development Plan - vedarogue

## Current Objective
Align research notebooks and docker tooling with the subtree sync workflow.

## Next Step
- Check docker/Makefile documentation for branch references and refresh them to mention `from-monorepo-main`.

## Backlog
- Plan test run of new docker images once docs updated.
- Document how managed workers should interact with notebook pipelines.

## Notes
- Capture outcomes after each managed worker run and update this plan accordingly.
- codex-cli unavailable on current host; managed worker execution deferred.
